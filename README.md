**Repository for the Unity part of the project called BluePrint**

## Documentation
The documentation generated is extracted from the code under the Assets/Scripts folder and its subfolders.
Other folders were not examined because they do no contain code, are third-party related or are already documented somewhere else (e.g. tests are already documented in Testing & Quality document with a more suitable description).
